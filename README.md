### Colour:

The aim of the colour scheme was to keep in line with the overall quiz theme being Software Development, After some Research i found Implementing  shades of blue and darker blue achieved a 
"Digital" feel to overall site enhancing user experience. The digital background image also pushes the more "Digital/Computer" theme to the user at first view.
